            <p class="MAPS_p1">
                MAPS is an extensive photometric and spectroscopic survey designed to target red, metal-poor giant stars to study the outer periphery regions of the Large and 
                Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC/SMC). The figure to the right shows a spatial map in Magellanic Stream coordinates of all the spectroscopic data from MAPS (\( \gtrsim \) 12 degrees) and APOGEE (\( \lesssim \) 12 degrees).
                The bulk of the data was acquired at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) with the Washington photometric system and hydra spectrograph on the 4-meter Blanco telescope, with some additional spectra acquired with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan-2 Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.
                With the help of Gaia astrometry to obtain proper motions, I use MAPS to study the full 3D kinematics and chemistry of the outer periphery and halo-like populations of the LMC. Additionally, with the help of APOGEE for the inner  disk,
                we can trace the evolution of the nominal disk kinematics to the perturbed periphery. I am currently working on writing MAPS paper I, outlining the survey description, target selection, data reduction, analysis procedures, and general periphery results.
                This paper should be published no later than 2025.

            <p class="NA_p1">
             The "Northern Arm" of the LMC is a low-surface-brightness stellar overdensity region in the outer LMC that extends \( \gtrsim \) 10 kpc towards the east.
             Using MAPS, APOGEE, SDSS-V, and <em>Gaia</em>, my work aims to uncover the dynamic and structural properties of this perturbed region. By analyzing the 3D kinematics of giant stars, we can identify kinematically distinct populations that belong to this disturbed structure, which, for the first time, can be traced well within the LMC disk. See the figure to the left for an example of the kinematic peculiarity of the Northern Arm feature compared to the rest of the LMC disk and periphery.
             Using red clump stars for accurate distance measurements, we can study the kinematic trends over a length of 17 kpc of this feature.
             By comparing these findings with full N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we aim to better discern the LMC's past evolutionary history. The culmination of this project will be presented in a forthcoming paper.

            <h1 class="research_h1"> LMC Stellar Halo Analysis </h1>
            <p class="research_p1">
                A long outstanding question over dwarf satellite galaxies (like the LMC) is whether or not
                they host accreted stellar halos. This begs the question if possesion of a stellar halo is dependent on disk size in spiral galaxies or total galaxy mass. 
                To help answer this question I am using MAPS data to study a group of giant stars possibly belonging to a stellar halo of the LMC. By analyzing the kinematics, 
                metallicities, and spatial distribution of these giant stars, my research aims to distinguish between stars that are part of an accreted halo and those that may 
                have originated from the LMC's disk. This involves comparing observational data with theoretical models of galaxy evolution and accretion, as well as N-body simulations 
                of the LMC's interactions with the SMC and the Milky Way. Identifying a distinct stellar halo around the LMC would not only provide insights into 
                the formation history of the galaxy but also shed light on how dwarf galaxies evolve in the presence of larger host galaxies. These findings could help clarify whether stellar
                halos are a universal feature of galaxies or a product of specific environmental and evolutionary conditions.

            <p class="research_p_3">
                The role of star formation (SF) quenching in the hierarchical model of the development of galaxies in 
                our universe has long been an unsolved puzzle. Using Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) + 
                Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data, I investigated SF signatures on a sample of 172 low-z (z â‰¤ 0.08)
                Recently Quenched Ellipticals (RQEs). This sample came from a parent catalog analyzed by <a href="https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/442/1/533/1230759" style="color: #526fff";> McIntosh et al. 2014</a> (Figure to the left). Through a careful analysis of Near-Ultraviolet (NUV) light, I 
                discovered 26 RQEs that have evidence of recent SF. Of the recent SF RQEs, they all are the lightest in 
                stellar mass, bluest in color and faintest in r-band flux; which is in agreement with the hierarchical 
                model of the development of galaxies. Furthermore, I have discovered at least 3 galaxies in this sample that can 
                be considered actively star forming based on their urz color and location on NUVur color plots. 
                Presumably, through an analysis of color-color-age plots, rejuvenation processes are the main cause of 
                these active and recent SF ellipticals. Finally, I advise that the 3 ellipticals that were discovered to 
                have active SF should be eliminated from further analyses of RQEs because they ultimately fail to be 
                considered true RQEs. This research was concluded with writing a research report that can be found <a href="https://slateroden.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/galex_analysis_of_recently_quenched_ellipticals_rqes_technical_report.pdf" style="color: #526fff;" class="paper1"> here</a>

            <h1 class="research_h4"> Major Merger Residuals Analysis </h1>
            <p class="research_p4">
                In this analysis, I analyzed the residual substructures of a representative sample of 500
                galaxies obtained from a larger sample of 10,000 galaxies, all with stellar masses > 10^(9.5) MâŠ™ and 
                redshift between 0.5 < z < 3. I develop 6 classification schemes of residual substructures that appear 
                to be universal to a multitude of tidal features. Through running a tidal feature (TF) finder python code
                on a sample of these galaxies, I found that at least 3 of the 6 classification schemes are strongly 
                supported by the results of the TF finder code and are applicable as ground truths for a residual 
                classification Machine Learning (ML) software. Whereas, the other 3 classification schemes are not 
                strongly supported by this analysis and should be analyzed further into whether or not they can be 
                considered ground truths for a residual ML software.
